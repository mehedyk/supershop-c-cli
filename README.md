### 🌟 About the Developer

I'm a passionate software engineering student with a keen interest in developing practical, user-friendly applications. This project started as a learning exercise when I was beginning my coding journey, and it has evolved into a comprehensive system that demonstrates the power of simple, well-structured code.

The main authenticity of this code lies in its simplicity. It was written when I was still learning the fundamentals, which forced me to improvise and create something truly beginner-friendly. Later, I refined and upgraded it to make it even more accessible to newcomers in programming.
