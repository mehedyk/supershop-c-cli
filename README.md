# 🛒 Super Shop Management System (CLI - C Version)

A simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) based Super Shop Management System written in C.  
The main authenticity of this code is simplicity. The code was written when I didn't understand a lot of coding. So, I had to improvise, and the code became very beginner-friendly. Later, it was simplified further with some upgrades.
